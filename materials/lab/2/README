Due: Feb 11 2022

1. Update Your Forked Repository
2. Navigate to > materials > lab > 2
3. bhg-scanner folder has
   1. main > main.go : in this folder `go build` then `./main`
   2. scanner > scanner.go and scanner_test.go  : in this folder `go test`
4. Complete the TODO's listed in scanner > scanner.go
5. Make one major other modification to the code; update/add a test or two
6. Update the README file in bhg-scanner that describes, 1 what the code does, modification to the code (based on the todos) AND includes details of the modification you chose to make in #5


Submit: 


1. Captured Output (csv file)
2. Screen Capture of timing information (e.g.,> time ./YourBinary )
3. Link to your updated code in your github repository (should be publically accessible) 

1) The code is a port scanner. You can provide an address (followed by a colon)
    as well as a range of what ports you want to look through. 
2) Modification to the code: 
    Todo 1: Added my name and some detail on how to run the code
    Todo 2: Replaced the original timing mech with dialTimeout
    Todo 3: Added an int that tracked closed ports. Chose an int instead of a slice to save memory
    Todo 4: No changes. 100 is a fine number of channels.
    Todo 5: Added an TUI that can take an address, along with a range of what ports to scan
    Todo 6: Returned info on ports scanned for testing and output

3) To run, you can either do 
        cd C:\Users\wrbra\Desktop\COSC\Cyber\course-materials\materials\lab\2\bhg-scanner\main\
        go build
        ./main
    And then follow the prompts or
        cd C:\Users\wrbra\Desktop\COSC\Cyber\course-materials\materials\lab\2\bhg-scanner\scanner
        go test
